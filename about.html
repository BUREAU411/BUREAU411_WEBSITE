        <p>
            Founded by Assi Joseph Meidan and Dror Tshuva, Bureau411 is a design and architecture studio dedicated to exploring aesthetics that reveal the structural and material truth of objects and spaces across various scales and scopes of work. The studio’s projects blend creative expression with architectural purpose, resulting in spaces and objects that strive to be both visually compelling and functional. This approach allows them to navigate between art, design, and structural integrity. Together, they practice minimalism that enhances significance, stripping designs to their essence to ensure every element serves a practical or emotional role.

            Craftsmanship is at the heart of effort. The designs are grounded in a respect for materials and the process of creation. Whether it’s a “one-of” object, a series, or an entire space, each project is made with attention to detail, ensuring a final product rich in texture or in lack-there-of, and techniques - and thus, in meaning.

            By reusing materials—often salvaged or recycled—not only reduced waste is achievable, but also a small history is embedded in a new object. In other words, reused material is curated, rather than merely used, as every object, structure, and space is one part of an ongoing dialogue between past and present, where the memories of materials are as important as their functional role. This principle forms the core of Bureau411’s aesthetic - celebrating what has been, while embracing what can be, and what could have been and hadn’t.
